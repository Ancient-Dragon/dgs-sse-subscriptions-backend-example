Java DGS Framework POST SSE subscriptions
=====

To run this please use jdk 9+ (tested using open-jdk18)

Feel free to generate your own certificate, I just created a simple one following: https://www.baeldung.com/spring-boot-https-self-signed-certificate

To see it not working, just version 5.0.4 of the dgs framework

Please run the makefile command in my dgs branch to publish to your local maven before installing the dependencies here.
